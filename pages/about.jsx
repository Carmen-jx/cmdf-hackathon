    <br></br>
    <h2>What?</h2>    
        <ul>
        Our mission is to facilitate meaningful connections in mentor/mentee 
            relationships by fostering an environment for marginalized groups 
            where individuals are not judged based on their gender, disabilities, 
            culture, or beliefs.
        </ul>
        <br></br>
    <h2>Why?</h2>
    <ul>
        As humans, it is our duty to support each other, embracing diversity in 
            appearance, overcoming physical challenges, and respecting individual 
            identities. Hence, we passionately believe in the inherent right of everyone 
            to access a nurturing and inclusive learning community.
    </ul>
        <br></br>
